pencil_tiles
============

a port of style tiles for use with the Evolus Pencil project

##Intro
 [Samantha Warren](http://badassideas.com/) created the lovely [Style Tiles project](http://www.styletil.es). You should visit and read all about the intent of the project. 
 My use case is such that it compliments a wireframe. Where the wireframe focuses on layout the Style Tile focuses on look and feel without being a mockup yet more concrete than a mood board.

 ##Why this "fork"
 Samantha provides a .psd template as a kickoff point but my Photoshop workflow sucks. Also I already do wireframes with Evolus Pencil and this is complimentary to wireframes in my workflow. So I decided to keep the work in the same tool. Also Pencil allows for additionall CSS styling on some elements which makes it more faithful to the web than Photoshop.
